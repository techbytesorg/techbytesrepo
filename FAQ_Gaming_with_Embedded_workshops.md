**What will students get out of this workshop?**

Through these 4 Embedded Systems hands-on workshop, we plan to go through

   the basics of Digital Logic and a hands on simulated Circuit Design task.
   the basics of MicroController and a hands on simulated Arduino, Mirobit based project and Microbit based game.
   
Attending these workshops will definitely give participants a head start on these topics. 

**Is it necessary to attend all the 4 workshops?**

Yes, we believe attending these 4 workshops together will give a good understanding on Embedded Systems and create an interest among students to 
do their own projects with Embedded Systems. 

**What is your policy for cancellation?**

We will deduct EventBrite charges (if booked through EventBrite) and will credit you the rest, if cancelled 1 day before the first workshop (Mar 14).

**Can the students bring food?**

These workshops are conducted in Surrey Library and hence no food is allowed inside the meeting room.
