**What will students get out of this workshop?**

Through these 4 Embedded Systems hands-on workshop, we plan to go through 

   1) the basics of Digital Logic and a hands on simulated Circuit Design task.
   2) the basics of MicroController and a hands on simulated Arduino, Mirobit based project and Microbit based game.
   
Attending these workshops will definitely give participants a head start on these topics. 

**Is it necessary to attend all the 4 workshops?**

Yes, we believe attending these 4 workshops together will give a good understanding on Embedded Systems and create an interest among students to 
do their own projects with Embedded Systems. 

**What is your policy for cancellation?**

We will deduct EventBrite charges (if booked through EventBrite) and will credit you the rest, if cancelled 1 day before the first workshop (Mar 14).

**Can students bring food?**

These workshops are conducted in Surrey Library and hence no food is allowed inside the meeting room.

**Anything else students need to be aware of?**

Parents please go through the Terms and Conditions for attending our workshops at https://github.com/techbytesorg/techbytesrepo/blob/master/TermsandConditions.md 
Please check our Privacy Policy and Photography policy at https://github.com/techbytesorg/techbytesrepo/blob/master/PrivacyPolicy.md

**Give me more details about your Payback program?**

Sure. To encourage students to practice what they learn in our workshops - we will give future workshop credits upto 50% of the workshop fee for those students
who try a hands on project on the discussed topics in workshops and send it to us. 

**Hmmm not clear, can you give me some more details?**

Sure, each week we encourage students to try their own ideas on the discussed topics in workshop and send us back a video/link of their project.
For each video/link sent to us, students will get 50% (7.50$ worth of credit) credit for attending our future workshops. So if a student attends 4 series of
workshops and sent us back 4 videos/links which they had created at home, students can get upto 30$ worth of credit for our future workshops.
